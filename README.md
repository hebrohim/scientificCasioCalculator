## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS clip path
- Mobile-first workflow
- javascript math functions
- javascript DOM
### What I learned

- I learnt how to use javascript math function like math.random,math.ceil,math.floor,math.sqrt etc.
- I also learnt  how to use CSS clipath to create any shape . i used the clippath to design the shape of the calculator


### Continued development
i still need to work more on the responsiveness

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp) - This helped me to understand math function very well
